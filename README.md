# OctoPrint-RequestBack

Octoprint plugin that allows your Marlin based 3D printer to create a put request out of an action. 
So your printer could talk to an API for example. 

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:
